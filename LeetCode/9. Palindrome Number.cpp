/*
 * Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.
 *
 * click to show spoilers.
 * Some hints:
 * Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)
 *
 * If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction of using extra space.
 *
 * You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the problem "Reverse Integer", you know that the reversed integer might overflow. How would you handle such case?
 *
 * There is a more generic way of solving this problem.
